# Kravity 🌌

**Gamifying Self Defense with Machine Learning**

Kravity is a mobile-first AR platform built to make self-defense training fun, accessible, and engaging.  
Developed at [HopHacks Fall 2025](https://hophacks-fall-2025.devpost.com/) by [Ethan Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethangwang/), [Alyssa Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssa-xu28/), and [Ankur Senapati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankur-senapati/), Kravity transforms physical motion into an interactive self-defense experience through real-time AR tracking, gamification, and personalized feedback.

## 🚀 Inspiration
Traditional self-defense training can feel repetitive, intimidating, and inaccessible. We wanted to reimagine the process — blending **gaming mechanics**, **augmented reality**, and **motion tracking** to make training **immersive, safe, and fun**.

---

## 🎮 What It Does
- **AR Motion Tracking** – Uses camera-based body tracking to detect and grade defensive stances.  
- **Gravity-Based Challenges** – Real-time simulations force quick reactions under pressure.  
- **Gamification Layer** – XP, streaks, leaderboards, and progress tracking to encourage consistency.  
- **Adaptive Feedback** – Personalized guidance on form, timing, and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Frameworks**: React, Next.js  
- **APIs & Tools**: MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js  
- **Platforms**: Web + Mobile (React Native)  
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)  
- **Design**: Figma, Canva
